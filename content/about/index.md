## Meet the Team

### David “Pete” Peterson Co-owner/operator
Pete began printing at the age of 15 in Price, Utah. He worked his way up the corporate ladder and enjoyed working for some of the world's largest corporations. He enjoys golf, a well-manicured lawn, tinkering in his garage, organization, and the smell of the forest, on a cool summer day.

### LeeAnn Peterson Co-owner/operator
LeeAnn has been part of Color Quick since its conception. She left her full-time, stay-at-home-mom gig, and began learning the ins and outs of the business and how to manipulate files to print correctly. In the process, she discovered her love for graphic design. She now specializes in wedding invitations. She enjoys laughing until it hurts, the smell of rain on hot cement, playing games, baking, making soap, and playing with her grandkids.

### Together:
Married 41 years and counting // Work + Play + Dream // Best friends // 3 kids + 1 daughter-in-law + 3 grandkids // Life couldn't be better
